# Python Learning Series

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! 🚀

This repository documents my journey as I learn Python, starting from the basics and advancing towards libraries and machine learning. Here, you'll find organized notes, code examples, and mini-projects as I progress through different stages of the Python language and ecosystem.

## 📚 What’s Covered?

- **Python Basics**  
  Variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, and more.

- **File Handling**  
  Reading from and writing to files, handling different file formats, and working with file paths.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more OOP concepts.

- **Libraries & Frameworks**  
  Exploration of popular Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) and their practical applications.

- **Machine Learning Foundations**  
  Introduction to machine learning using Python, with simple ML projects and experiments.

## 📝 Structure
